  <h2>Machine Learning Model</h2>
  We have used the Social_Network.csv dataset and created a mahcine learning model using the KNN classification algorithm.The model analyses the performance of the    classifier with various performance measures such as confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, f-score, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) score. g and displays the information in a graph. Also, the model displays the accuracy details of Kmean=3,5,7,9,11.

  <h2>Machine Learning Model for understanding rainfall pattern</h2>
  This ML model analyses and understands the rainfall pattern considering the district-wise rainfall data from the dataset. The model is made using linearregression. The model accepts the user input of any district of tamil nadu and displays the data of the 4 seasons and the rainfall pattern of the district of the 4 seasons.
