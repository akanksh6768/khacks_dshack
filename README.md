**  Machine Learning Model**
  We have used the Social_Network.csv dataset and created a mahcine learning model using the KNN classification algorithm.The model analyses the performance of the    classifier with various performance measures such as confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, f-score, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) score. g and displays the information in a graph. Also, the model displays the accuracy details of Kmean=3,5,7,9,11.
